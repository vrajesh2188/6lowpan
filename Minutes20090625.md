The discussions entailed
  * General overview of the 6LoWPAN protocol is done getting a rough idea about the product main features
  * A few questions already are on the table:
    * what are features of the products that are already on the market and what and how we can use them (J-M already noted ATMEL as preferred chipset)
    * what Java demo should be really doing
    * how "open" our source code will be
  * Decision to use google project hosting tool for the beginning is made
  * Vladimir will be in charge of managing the project and communicating the J-M
  * Next meeting is scheduled

Things to be done:
  * For the next meeting to get familiar with 6LoWPAN protocol and ATMEL chipset/protocol stack with the data available on Internet
  * For the next meeting to analyze ATMEL presentation provided by J-M (attached in this mail - the same file you could find in mail from Jean-Marc that I already forwarded to you)
  * during the following meeting to come out with the list of product requirements and questions for J-M
  * Mehmet will come out with the Google project hosting and communicating infrastructure
  * Vladimir will come out with the concept of managing the project
    * practices, documents, ....

**NEXT MEETING:** is originally scheduled for Tuesday, 1st of July at 10am in Audrey's office at 6th floor, but since Jean-Marc will be available only at the same time, we should meet at the same place one hour earlier in order to generate list of product requirements and questions.

So, next meeting is scheduled for 1st of July at 9 am in Audrey's office at 6th floor. Sorry for this late update, but I've just received this information this morning.
